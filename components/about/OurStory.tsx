              &quot;Honoring our ancestors by building a future that reflects their vision of unity, excellence, and progress.&quot;

            <p>
              Nu Al Andalusia is the modern provincial expression of the historical Moroccan Empire, lawfully continued under international law and recognized treaty frameworks. Our position is grounded in the doctrine of uti possidetis juris, which preserves pre-existing sovereign boundaries and rights despite later colonial or administrative alterations. Accordingly, Nu Al Andalusia functions as the Provincial Government of the Moroccan Empire within the territory now administratively identified as the State of Florida.
            </p>

            <p>
              While Nu Al Andalusia shares geographic jurisdiction with the State of Florida, it maintains a superior and antecedent legal standing derived from Morocco&apos;s continuous treaty recognition and sovereign character. Our nationals have lawfully returned to Moroccan jurisdiction through full submission to the Moslem Law of the Empire of Morocco, in accordance with Article 15 of the Treaty of Madrid of 1880. This return is not symbolic—it is legal, deliberate, and rooted in binding international agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              The foundation of our authority is further affirmed by a continuous body of international instruments, including the Moroccan–American Treaties of Peace and Friendship of 1786 and 1836, the Moroccan–Anglo Treaty of 1856 and its Most Favored Nation Clause, the Act of Algeciras of 1906, the Treaty of Fez of 1912, and the Franco–Moroccan Agreement of 1956. Collectively, these instruments demonstrate Morocco&apos;s longstanding sovereignty and, critically, reveal the interruption of lawful governance following the removal of a recognized Head of State and the dissolution of the Sharifian Makhzen (the governing body of the Empire).
            </p>

            <p>
              In response to this historical rupture, the Moors of Morocco Major now unite to reestablish the Moroccan Empire, not as a new state, but as the lawful continuation of an ancient and recognized one. Nu Al Andalusia has reactivated Consular Courts and institutional mechanisms that will progress through structured stages of advancement to restore governance, regulate trade, and uphold justice throughout the Empire.
